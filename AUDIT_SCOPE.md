# Audit Scope - HLG Staking Bootstrap Strategy

## Context

We're launching HLG token staking rewards using a simplified manual operational model rather than our full automated cross-chain protocol. This bootstrap approach lets us get to market quickly while validating tokenomics before building the complete automated infrastructure.

The core concept: instead of complex LayerZero cross-chain messaging and automated DEX swaps, we'll manually bridge fees from Base to Ethereum weekly and call a single new function that handles the burn/reward distribution.

## What Needs Auditing

**Primary Contract**: `src/StakingRewards.sol` (630 lines)

This is the only new contract requiring audit. It handles HLG token staking with auto-compounding rewards and a configurable burn percentage.

**Key Functions**:

`depositAndDistribute(uint256 hlgAmount)` (lines 189-209):
- Manual bootstrap reward distribution 
- Takes HLG from owner, splits based on `burnPercentage` (default 50/50)
- Burns portion via HLG token's `burn()` function, auto-compounds remainder

`addRewards(uint256 amount)` (lines 217-238):
- Future automated reward distribution from FeeRouter
- Same burn/reward logic as depositAndDistribute but called by FeeRouter

`batchStakeFor()` (lines 526-569):
- Referral rewards initialization (up to 250M HLG total, max 780K per user)
- Owner-only, paused-only, gas-optimized batch processing

`stakeFromDistributor()` (lines 591-609):
- Allows whitelisted contracts to stake on behalf of users
- For future campaigns like Merkle drops, quest rewards, etc.

**External Dependencies**:
- Existing HLG token at `0x740dF024Ce73F589AcD5E8756B377eF8C6558BaB` on Ethereum mainnet
- This token implements `ERC20Burnable` interface (has a `burn()` function)
- OpenZeppelin contracts for access control, reentrancy guards, pausable functionality

## Operational Flow

![Bootstrap Strategy Flow](docs/images/holograph-rewards-bootstrap-strategy.png)

Weekly process:
1. 0x Protocol generates trading fees on Base
2. Multisig splits: 50% to treasury, 50% bridged to Ethereum
3. Ethereum multisig swaps ETH â†’ HLG on Uniswap
4. Call `depositAndDistribute()` with the HLG amount
5. Contract burns 50%, auto-compounds 50% to all stakers

This replaces what would eventually be a complex system involving LayerZero V2 cross-chain messaging, automated Uniswap swaps, and multiple contracts across chains.

## Security Considerations

**Access Control**: Owner-only functions include reward distribution, referral initialization, emergency recovery. Owner is a multisig wallet.

**Burn Mechanism**: Uses the HLG token's native `burn()` function with supply reduction verification to ensure burns actually reduce total supply.

**Auto-Compounding**: Uses high-precision math (1e12 scaling) to track rewards proportionally across all stakers with no loss due to rounding.

**Fee-on-Transfer Protection**: The `_pullHLG()` function explicitly rejects tokens that take fees on transfer, requiring exact amounts received.

**Pausable Design**: Contract starts paused. When paused, users can withdraw but cannot stake. Reward distribution and distributor staking also blocked while paused.

**Emergency Recovery**: Multiple recovery mechanisms for different scenarios:
- `recoverExtraHLG()` - recover HLG accidentally sent to contract
- `reclaimUnallocatedRewards()` - reclaim rewards when no active stakers  
- `sweepETH()` - recover accidentally sent ETH

**Reentrancy Protection**: All external functions use OpenZeppelin's `nonReentrant` modifier.

- `ProcessReferralCSV.s.sol` - Referral rewards batch processing script
- `ts/multisig-cli.ts` - TypeScript tooling for multisig operations
- `ts/services/StakingService.ts` - Service layer for staking operations

**Tests** (`test/`):
- `StakingRewards.t.sol` - Unit tests covering all staking scenarios
- `invariant/StakingRewardsInvariants.t.sol` - Property-based testing
- `mock/MockHLG.sol` - Test implementation of HLG token interface

## Out of Scope

- Full cross-chain protocol contracts (not being deployed)
- HolographERC20.sol (reference only - we use existing HLG token)
- LayerZero integration contracts
- Automated DEX swap contracts
- Any contracts in `src/` other than `StakingRewards.sol`

## Testing

The contract has extensive test coverage including unit tests for all staking/unstaking scenarios, reward distribution and compounding logic, emergency functions and edge cases, and invariant tests. All tests pass with Solidity 0.8.30.
