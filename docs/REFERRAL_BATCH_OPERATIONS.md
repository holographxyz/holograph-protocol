# Referral Reward Batch Operations Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the operational procedures for executing the referral waitlist reward distribution using the batch staking functionality in the StakingRewards contract.

## Gas Cost Analysis

### Gas Cost Analysis Tool

The protocol includes a single, focused gas analysis tool that provides real-time cost optimization:

**Gas Analysis** (`make gas-analysis`):
- Fetches live ETH/USD prices from Chainlink mainnet oracle
- Tests gas consumption via mainnet fork testing
- Dynamically determines optimal batch size (typically 500 users)
- Provides essential cost information: total cost in ETH and USD

### Gas Cost Analysis Results

**Current Measurements:**
- **Gas per user**: ~1,139 gas (measured via mainnet fork)
- **Optimal batch size**: 500 users per batch
- **Total gas for 5,000 users**: 5,695,000 gas
- **Total batches needed**: 10 batches

### Live Cost Analysis (5,000 users)

**Real-Time Cost Analysis** (Live ETH Price via Chainlink):

| Gas Price | Total ETH Cost | Total USD Cost | Cost Per User |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| 0.2 gwei  | 0.001 ETH      | $4.18          | $0.0008       |
| 0.5 gwei  | 0.003 ETH      | $10.45         | $0.002        |
| 1 gwei    | 0.006 ETH      | $20.89         | $0.004        |
| 2 gwei    | 0.011 ETH      | $41.79         | $0.008        |
| 5 gwei    | 0.028 ETH      | $104.48        | $0.02         |
| 10 gwei   | 0.057 ETH      | $208.96        | $0.04         |

**Important**: These are **ETH gas costs only** for executing batch transactions. They do NOT include the HLG tokens being distributed to users. Live ETH price via Chainlink oracle. Gas measurements via mainnet fork testing.

### Execution Strategy

**Optimal Execution Windows:**
- **Best**: Weekends Saturday/Sunday 2-6 AM UTC (0.2-0.5 gwei typical)
- **Good**: Weekdays Tuesday-Thursday 3-5 AM UTC (0.5-1 gwei)  
- **Avoid**: High-activity periods (5+ gwei)
- **Target gas price**: 0.2-1 gwei for optimal costs

**Real-Time Monitoring:**
1. Run `make gas-analysis` before execution for current costs
2. Monitor https://etherscan.io/gastracker for live gas prices
3. Set alerts on Blocknative for <1 gwei notifications
4. Check current ETH price impact on total costs

**Cost Optimization:**
- **Very low gas environment** makes execution extremely cost-effective
- **Target 0.2-1 gwei** for optimal execution costs
- Share gas analysis output with team for approval before execution
- Remember: Gas costs are only for transaction execution, not HLG token distribution

## Pre-Execution Checklist

### 1. Contract Preparation
- [ ] Deploy StakingRewards contract with owner address
- [ ] Verify contract is paused (starts paused by default)
- [ ] Verify HLG token address is correctly set
- [ ] Set FeeRouter address if needed

### 2. CSV Preparation
- [ ] Export referral data from waitlist system
- [ ] Format: `address,amount` (amounts in whole HLG, no decimals)
- [ ] Validate no duplicate addresses
- [ ] Verify no user exceeds 780,000 HLG cap
- [ ] Confirm total allocation â‰¤ 250M HLG

### 3. HLG Token Preparation
- [ ] Transfer required HLG to deployer wallet
- [ ] Add 0.1% buffer for gas variations
- [ ] Verify deployer has enough ETH for gas

### 4. Environment Setup
```bash
# Create .env file
PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
STAKING_REWARDS=0x...
HLG_TOKEN=0x...
REFERRAL_CSV_PATH=./referral_data.csv
BATCH_SIZE=500                    # Optional, defaults to 500 users per batch
REFERRAL_RESUME_INDEX=0           # Optional, resume from specific user index
```

## Execution Procedures

### Step 1: Generate Sample Data (Testing)
```bash
forge script script/ProcessReferralCSV.s.sol:GenerateSampleCSV \
  --sig "run()" \
  -vvv
```

### Step 2: Validate CSV Data
```bash
# Dry run to validate without broadcasting
forge script script/ProcessReferralCSV.s.sol:ProcessReferralCSV \
  --sig "run()" \
  --fork-url $ETH_RPC_URL \
  -vvv
```

### Step 3: Run Gas Analysis
```bash
# Run gas cost analysis
make gas-analysis

# This provides:
# - Current ETH price via Chainlink oracle
# - Gas per user measurement via mainnet fork
# - Total cost in ETH and USD across different gas price scenarios
# - Optimal batch size and execution plan
```

### Step 4: Monitor Gas Prices
- Check https://etherscan.io/gastracker
- Set alerts on Blocknative for < 5 gwei
- Use gas analysis tools to determine optimal execution timing
- Use Flashbots RPC to avoid MEV: https://rpc.flashbots.net

### Step 5: Execute Batch Staking
```bash
# When gas is favorable, execute with broadcast
forge script script/ProcessReferralCSV.s.sol:ProcessReferralCSV \
  --sig "run()" \
  --fork-url $ETH_RPC_URL \
  --broadcast \
  --verify \
  --gas-price 1gwei \
  -vvv
```

### Step 6: Post-Execution Verification
1. Verify all batches completed successfully
2. Check a sample of user balances
3. Verify total staked matches expected amount
4. Document actual gas used and costs

## Batch Execution Details

For 5,000 users (with dynamically optimized batch size):
- **Total batches**: 10 (at 500 users/batch)
- **Batch breakdown**:
  - Batches 1-10: 500 users each
- **Estimated time**: 15-20 minutes total
- **Time between batches**: 2-3 minutes for confirmation

### Batch Schedule (Dynamic Optimization)
| Batch | User Range  | Size | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------|------|------------|
| 1     | 0-499       | 500  | 500        |
| 2     | 500-999     | 500  | 1,000      |
| 3     | 1000-1499   | 500  | 1,500      |
| 4     | 1500-1999   | 500  | 2,000      |
| 5     | 2000-2499   | 500  | 2,500      |
| 6     | 2500-2999   | 500  | 3,000      |
| 7     | 3000-3499   | 500  | 3,500      |
| 8     | 3500-3999   | 500  | 4,000      |
| 9     | 4000-4499   | 500  | 4,500      |
| 10    | 4500-4999   | 500  | 5,000      |

*Batch sizes are dynamically optimized by the gas analysis tools. The above shows typical optimization results.*

## Emergency Procedures

### If Batch Fails
1. Note the last successful user index from console output
2. Fix the issue (gas price spike, network congestion)
3. Resume from the failed point using REFERRAL_RESUME_INDEX
4. Verify no users were double-initialized

**Resume Example:**
```bash
# If execution fails at user index 2500
export REFERRAL_RESUME_INDEX=2500
forge script script/ProcessReferralCSV.s.sol:ProcessReferralCSV \
  --sig "run()" \
  --fork-url $ETH_RPC_URL \
  --broadcast \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  -vvv

# The script will:
# - Skip users 0-2499 (already processed)
# - Only approve HLG for users 2500+
# - Continue batch processing from user 2500
```

### If Wrong Amounts Distributed
1. Contract is paused - users cannot unstake yet
2. Deploy new StakingRewards contract
3. Re-execute batch staking with correct amounts
4. Update FeeRouter to point to new contract

## Post-Launch Operations

1. **Unpause Contract**: After all batches complete successfully
2. **Monitor Initial Claims**: Watch for users unstaking
3. **Verify Rewards**: Ensure future rewards distribute correctly
4. **Document Results**: Record actual gas costs and any issues

## Security Considerations

- **Private Key Security**: Use hardware wallet or secure key management
- **Transaction Monitoring**: Watch each batch for anomalies
- **Verification**: Always dry-run before broadcasting
- **Backup Plan**: Have contingency contract ready if issues arise

## Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Use Gas Tokens**: If available, use CHI or GST2 for additional savings
2. **Flashbots Bundle**: Group transactions to ensure atomic execution
3. **Weekend Execution**: Consistently lowest gas prices
4. **Gas Price Alerts**: Set multiple alerts at different thresholds
5. **Prepare Everything**: Have all transactions ready to execute quickly
