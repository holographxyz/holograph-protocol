             - one bridge, infinite possibilities -
```

If you're using a node version manager `nvm install` or make sure to use `v16.6.1`.

Install all the dev packages `npm install`.

Copy over shared env configs and mnemonic `cp sample.env .env && cp sample.mnemonic .mnemonic`.

Make missing data dir `mkdir data`, where all contract addresses are stored for reference and re-use.

In a separate terminal run ganache by `npm run-script ganache`, to run two separate instances of ganache, run `npm run-script ganache-x2`, to run the second instance only, `npm run-script ganache2`.

Build the latest version of the project with `npm run-script build-compile`.

End to end testing can be done with `npm run-script test`.

The deployment script will accomplish the following: deploy the entire protocol on both chains, create the same collection on each chain, set `.env $NETWORK` chain as original chain, mint sample NFTs on origin chain, and on foreign chain, test basic info validation, and simple functionality like `transferFrom`.

Once the deployment has been done, multi-chain transfers can be tested with `npm run-script test-bridge`. This script tests `bridgeOut` and `bridgeIn` requests between `NETWORK` and `NETWORK2`.
