## Description

Holograph provides omnichain NFT infrastructure for the web3 ecosystem. Holograph Protocol enables the creation, deployment, minting, & bridging of omnichain NFTs with complete data integrity.

## Development

### Getting started

1. This project uses [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) for versions management. Install following plugins 
   - Install [asdf Node plugin](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs): `asdf plugin add nodejs https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs.git`
   - Install [asdf yarn plugin](https://github.com/twuni/asdf-yarn): `asdf plugin-add yarn`
1. Run `asdf install` after to have the correct tool versions.
1. Install dependencies with `yarn install`.
1. Initialize the project with `yarn run init` _(this will copy sample environment configs)_.

### Building

All smart contracts source code is located in the `src` directory.

Files from the `src` directory are automatically transpiled into the `contracts` directory each time that **hardhat** compiles the contracts.

To manually run just the build task use `yarn run build`.

### Compiling, Testing, and Deploying (Locally)

1. Build the latest version of the contracts via `yarn run clean-compile` _(alternatively you can just run `yarn run compile`)_.
2. Start the localhost ganache instances via `yarn run ganache-x2` _(this will run two instances simultaneously inside of one command)_. **_Make sure to run this command in a separate terminal window._**
3. Deploy the smart contracts via `yarn run deploy`.
4. Run all tests via `yarn run test`.

_If you need the smart contracts ABI files for dApp integrations, use `yarn run abi` to get a complete list of all ABI's inside of the `abi` directory._

### Making Changes

**Before pushing your work to the repo, make sure to prepare your code**

Please make use of the `yarn run prettier:fix` command to format the codebase into a universal style.

## Branching Model and Releases

### Active Branches

| Branch                                                                     | Status                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [mainnet](https://github.com/holographxyz/holograph-protocol/tree/mainnet) | Accepts PRs from `testnet` or `relase/x.x.x` when we intend to deploy to mainnet.  |
| [testnet](https://github.com/holographxyz/holograph-protocol/tree/testnet) | Accepts PRs from `develop` that are ready to be deployed to testnet.               |
| [develop](https://github.com/holographxyz/holograph-protocol/tree/develop) | Accepts PRs from `feature/xyz` branches that are experimental or in testing stage. |
| release/x.x.x                                                              | Accepts PRs from `testnet`.                                                        |

### Overview

We generally follow [this Git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
Please read the linked post if you're planning to make frequent PRs into this repository.

### The `mainet` branch

The `master` branch contains the code for our latest "stable" mainnet releases.
Updates from `mainnet` always come from the `testnet` branch.
We only ever update the `mainnet` branch when we intend to deploy code that has been tested on testnets to all mainnet networks supported by the Holograph protocol.
Our update process takes the form of a PR merging the `testnet` branch into the `mainnet` branch.

### The `develop` branch

Our primary development branch is [`develop`](https://github.com/holographxyz/holograph-protocol/tree/testnet).
`develop` contains the most up-to-date software that is being tested via experimental network deployments.
